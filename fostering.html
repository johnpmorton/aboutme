<h1>Foster a Cat Today</h1>


<p>From fostering to donations there are many ways that you can contribute to saving cat lives. At Tails of Two Kitties our goal is to find suitable homes for all of our friendly cats. Our company realizes that many do not have the means to fully adopt a cat, this is why we allow fostering to loving and willing families. <br> Fostering a cat is when you and your family members will provide a loving home for the cat until the cat is adopted or you need to bring the cat back.  If you find that you cannot give the cat back and want to adopt it, you will be prioritized in the adoption process.  If you are interested the fostering application is located below. After this short application and approval, you and your family will be taking home one of our loving cats. </p>
