<h1> Why Volunteer?</h1>
<p>Cats are a domestics animal and needs proper care at all times, our staff does their best to provide each cat with the proper maintenance and care though we encourage volunteering to those who are willing. If you wish to volunteer, you must be over 21 years old and fill out a small application. Once this is done our team will evaluate your application and goals as a volunteer to determine what job and time you will volunteer. Volunteers are required to work as a pair until properly certified. </p>

<p>Our volunteering program provides multiple ways to contribute. You can choose to volunteer for adoptions where you will help maintain cats all day and talk to potential adopters and try to help them make their decision. In order to maintain the catâ€™s volunteers will need to help feed, clean litterboxes and maintain cages throughout the day. The other volunteering program we have is more administrative and deals with mailing and outreach programs where we try to find families who are willing to adopt of contribute to our cause. </p>
