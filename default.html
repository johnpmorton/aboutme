<h2> Our Mission</h2>

<p>The Tail of Two Kitties is a up and coming pet shop that aims to find a loving home for kitties and cats. Our rescue team of animal lovers works diligently every day to rehome abandoned cats and throwaway kittens. Not only does our team find and provide wonderful cats to families, our team ensures that every cat we put up for adoption is spay/neutered with all papers for the cat. If you are looking for a new addition to your loving family please stop by the Tail of Two Kitties where we can find you the perfect cat for your family. Most of our profits are also donated to <i>SAFE Haven</i>, a nonprofit organization that aims to prevent animal hording, provide shelters and maintain community cats.</p>
